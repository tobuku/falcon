      <h1>Anklets &amp; Bewits</h1>
      <p class="lede">Anklets are the foundation of the Aylmeri jess system, wrapping around the bird's tarsus and providing the attachment point for removable jesses. Bewits are the small leather strips used to attach bells and other accessories to the bird's legs. Both must be properly sized, well-made, and regularly inspected.</p>

      <h2 id="what-are-anklets">What Are Anklets?</h2>
      <p>In the Aylmeri jess system, anklets are the permanent leather bands that encircle the bird's tarsus (the scaled lower leg above the foot). Each anklet has a metal grommet or a button-and-loop closure through which the removable jess straps pass. The anklets remain on the bird at all times, whether the bird is tethered in the mews, sitting on the fist, or flying free in the field.</p>
      <p>Because anklets are worn continuously, they must be made from materials that are comfortable against the bird's skin, durable enough to withstand daily wear, and resistant to moisture from bathing and weather exposure. A poorly made or incorrectly sized anklet can cause pressure sores, restrict blood flow, or allow the bird to slip free.</p>
      <p>Anklets replaced the older practice of tying jesses directly to the bird's legs, which was less secure and more likely to cause abrasion. The Aylmeri system with grommeted anklets is now the accepted standard in American falconry, recommended by state wildlife agencies and the North American Falconers Association.</p>

      <h2 id="types">Anklet Types: Grommeted vs. Button</h2>

      <h3>Grommeted Anklets</h3>
      <p>Grommeted anklets are the most common type. A brass or stainless steel grommet is set into the leather at the overlap point, creating a reinforced hole through which the jess passes. The grommet prevents the leather from tearing at the jess slot and distributes the pulling force of a bating bird across a wider area.</p>
      <p>Quality grommets are set with a proper grommet tool that flares the back of the grommet tightly against the leather, creating a smooth surface on both sides. A poorly set grommet can have sharp edges that irritate the bird's leg or can spin freely in the leather, eventually enlarging the hole and compromising security.</p>
      <p>Grommeted anklets work well for most species and are the default choice for falconers flying red-tailed hawks, Harris's hawks, and most falcons. They are easy to make, easy to install, and jess changes are quick and straightforward.</p>

      <h3>Button Anklets</h3>
      <p>Button anklets use a small leather or bone button that passes through a slit in the opposite end of the anklet strip, creating a secure closure without metal hardware. The jess passes through a separate slit in the anklet near the button closure.</p>
      <p>Button anklets are preferred by some falconers for species with thin, delicate tarsi (such as kestrels and merlins) because the button closure can be made smaller and lighter than a grommet. They are also used when a falconer wants to avoid metal entirely, as some birds are sensitive to the weight or feel of brass grommets.</p>
      <p>The disadvantage of button anklets is that they are more difficult to install and adjust. The button must be sized precisely to hold securely without being so tight that it cannot be removed when the anklet needs replacement. Over time, the button slit can stretch, requiring earlier replacement than a grommeted anklet.</p>

      <h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
      <p>The material used for anklets directly affects the bird's comfort and the anklet's longevity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cowhide leather</strong> is the most traditional and widely available material. It is durable, relatively inexpensive, and provides good grip so the anklet does not spin on the bird's leg. Use chrome-tanned cowhide, which is softer and more moisture-resistant than vegetable-tanned. Vegetable-tanned leather can harden and crack when repeatedly wetted and dried.</li>
        <li><strong>Kangaroo leather</strong> is the premium choice for anklets. It is significantly stronger than cowhide at the same thickness, allowing thinner, lighter anklets that are less bulky on the bird's leg. Kangaroo leather is also naturally resistant to moisture and maintains its suppleness over extended periods. The cost is higher, but many falconers consider it worth the investment for a piece of equipment that contacts the bird's skin 24 hours a day.</li>
        <li><strong>Biothane</strong> is a synthetic material with a polyurethane coating over a nylon or polyester core. Biothane anklets are completely waterproof, do not stretch, and clean with a simple wipe. They are ideal for birds that bathe frequently or for use in wet climates. However, biothane is stiffer than leather and may not conform as comfortably to the bird's leg shape, particularly on species with thin or irregularly shaped tarsi.</li>
        <li><strong>Deerskin</strong> is occasionally used for small raptors. It is extremely soft and lightweight but lacks the durability and moisture resistance of cowhide or kangaroo leather. Deerskin anklets may need replacement more frequently.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sizing">Sizing by Species</h2>
      <p>Anklet sizing is critical. An anklet that is too tight will restrict circulation, especially if the bird's legs swell slightly from exertion or warm weather. An anklet that is too loose will allow the bird to slip its foot through and escape, or will spin and create friction burns.</p>
      <p>The correct fit allows you to slide one finger between the anklet and the bird's tarsus. The anklet should sit snugly without constricting. Measure the circumference of the tarsus at its widest point and add approximately a quarter inch for the overlap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>American Kestrel:</strong> Anklet width 3/8 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 0.75 to 0.9 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Merlin:</strong> Anklet width 3/8 to 1/2 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 0.9 to 1.1 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Cooper's Hawk:</strong> Anklet width 1/2 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 1.0 to 1.3 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Harris's Hawk:</strong> Anklet width 5/8 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 1.3 to 1.6 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Red-tailed Hawk:</strong> Anklet width 5/8 to 3/4 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 1.4 to 1.8 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Peregrine Falcon:</strong> Anklet width 1/2 to 5/8 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 1.1 to 1.5 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Gyrfalcon:</strong> Anklet width 5/8 to 3/4 inch, tarsus circumference approximately 1.4 to 1.7 inches</li>
        <li><strong>Golden Eagle:</strong> Anklet width 1 inch or wider, tarsus circumference approximately 2.0 to 2.5 inches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always measure your individual bird rather than relying solely on species averages. There is significant variation in tarsus thickness between males and females, between wild-caught and captive-bred birds, and between individual birds of the same species.</p>

      <h2 id="bewits">Bewits and Bell Attachment</h2>
      <p>A bewit is a short strip of leather used to attach a bell to the bird's leg or tail. The bewit wraps around the tarsus (above the anklet) and passes through a small slit in the bell's leather mounting tab. The bewit is then folded back on itself and held in place by its own tension and a small slit-and-tab closure.</p>
      <p>Bewits should be made from thin, supple leather that will not add unnecessary bulk to the bird's leg. Many falconers use the same material as their anklets (kangaroo or thin cowhide) for consistency. The width of a bewit is typically narrower than the anklet, usually 1/4 to 3/8 inch, just enough to securely hold the bell.</p>
      <p>Tail-mount bewits attach to the deck feathers (the central tail feathers) and hold a tail bell. Tail bells are positioned at the base of the tail using a bewit that wraps around the feather shaft. Tail-mounted bells produce a clearer, louder sound than leg bells because the tail moves more than the legs during flight.</p>

      <h2 id="bells">Choosing Bells</h2>
      <p>Bells are the original tracking device in falconry, predating electronic telemetry by centuries. A good falconry bell produces a clear, distinct tone that carries well over distance and is easily distinguishable from ambient sounds. There are two main types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lahore (Pakistani) bells</strong> are handmade brass bells from Pakistan with a bright, high-pitched ring that carries well in open terrain. They are lightweight and produce a consistent tone. Lahore bells are the traditional choice and remain popular for their sound quality and affordability.</li>
        <li><strong>Acorn bells</strong> are cast bells with a deeper, rounder tone. They are heavier than Lahore bells but produce a sound that some falconers find easier to hear in wooded environments where high-pitched sounds dissipate quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Select bell size based on the bird's weight. The bell should be large enough to produce an audible tone but not so heavy that it affects the bird's flight performance. For most hawks, a bell weighing 4 to 8 grams is appropriate. For large falcons and buteos, 6 to 12 grams works well. Kestrels and merlins need the smallest bells available, typically 2 to 4 grams.</p>
      <p>Many falconers use two bells: one on the leg and one on the tail. The two bells should have different pitches so you can distinguish leg movement from tail movement by sound alone, which provides information about the bird's activity when you cannot see it.</p>

      <h2 id="installation">Installation and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Installing anklets requires restraining the bird safely and working efficiently. Have all equipment prepared before handling the bird: anklets cut to size, grommets set, and bewits ready. The process should take no more than a few minutes per leg.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wrap the anklet</strong> around the tarsus with the grommet positioned on the outside of the leg. The overlap should face outward so the jess hangs cleanly without catching on the bird's body.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the fit</strong> by sliding one finger under the anklet. Adjust if necessary before securing.</li>
        <li><strong>Thread the jess</strong> through the grommet and verify that it moves freely and hangs without twisting.</li>
        <li><strong>Attach bewits and bells</strong> after the anklets are secure and the bird has been returned to the perch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inspect anklets daily for signs of wear, moisture damage, or loosening grommets. Replace anklets at least once per season or whenever the leather shows cracking, thinning, or discoloration that indicates deterioration. Keep spare anklets pre-made and ready so that replacement does not require extended handling time.</p>
