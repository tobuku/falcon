      <h1>Raptor Veterinarians</h1>
      <p class="lede">Raptors are not dogs or cats, and they cannot be treated like them. Birds of prey have unique physiology, mask illness until they are critically compromised, and require a veterinarian with specialized avian training to diagnose and treat effectively. Finding a qualified raptor vet before you need one is one of the most important steps any falconer can take.</p>

      <h2 id="why">Why Raptors Need Specialized Vets</h2>
      <p>Avian medicine is a distinct discipline from small-animal or large-animal practice. Raptors present additional challenges beyond those of pet parrots or poultry because they are wild or semi-wild predators with unique stress responses, metabolic rates, and behavioral patterns.</p>
      <p>A raptor&rsquo;s physiology differs fundamentally from mammals in ways that affect diagnosis and treatment. Their hollow, pneumatized bones fracture differently than mammalian bones. Their respiratory system&mdash;a network of air sacs connected to the lungs&mdash;makes them exceptionally vulnerable to airborne pathogens like <em>Aspergillus</em> fungal spores. Their high metabolic rate means that a bird showing visible symptoms of illness may have been declining for days or weeks before signs became apparent.</p>
      <p>General-practice veterinarians, even those comfortable with dogs and cats, typically lack the training and equipment to properly examine, diagnose, and treat raptors. Avian-specific diagnostics include endoscopy (to visualize air sacs and internal organs), specialized blood panels calibrated for avian reference ranges, and crop and fecal analysis techniques unfamiliar to most small-animal practitioners.</p>
      <p>Board-certified avian veterinarians (diplomates of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners, Avian Practice) have completed additional years of residency training focused on bird medicine. While not all excellent raptor vets are board-certified, the certification is a reliable indicator of deep expertise.</p>

      <h2 id="conditions">Common Raptor Health Issues</h2>
      <p>Falconers should be familiar with the most common health problems in captive and wild raptors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aspergillosis.</strong> A fungal infection caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> species that colonizes the respiratory tract. It is the leading cause of death in captive raptors. Aspergillosis thrives in damp, poorly ventilated environments and is extremely difficult to treat once established. Prevention through proper mews hygiene and ventilation is critical.</li>
        <li><strong>Bumblefoot (pododermatitis).</strong> An infection of the foot pad that begins as a small abrasion and, if untreated, progresses to a deep abscess that can invade bone and tendons. Bumblefoot is caused by improper perching surfaces, obesity, poor nutrition, or lack of exercise. Early-stage bumblefoot is treatable; advanced cases may require surgery.</li>
        <li><strong>Frounce (trichomoniasis).</strong> A protozoal infection of the mouth and crop caused by <em>Trichomonas gallinae</em>, typically contracted from infected prey (especially pigeons). Symptoms include white or yellow plaques in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and regurgitation. Frounce responds well to antiprotozoal medication when caught early.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal parasites.</strong> Coccidia, roundworms, capillaria, and tapeworms are common in wild-trapped birds and can develop in captive birds exposed to contaminated substrates. Routine fecal exams (at least annually, more often for newly trapped birds) are essential for early detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour crop.</strong> A condition where food ferments in the crop instead of passing normally into the stomach. Causes include bacterial or yeast infections, crop impaction, or feeding inappropriate items. A bird with sour crop will have a distended, foul-smelling crop and may refuse food.</li>
        <li><strong>West Nile Virus.</strong> Raptors are highly susceptible to WNV, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. Mortality rates in some raptor species exceed 50%. There is no approved vaccine for raptors, so mosquito control and housing management are the primary defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma.</strong> Hunting birds are athletes that operate in challenging environments. Collisions with fences, wire, and vehicles; talon punctures from quarry; and fractures from hard landings are all part of field falconry. A vet experienced with raptors knows how to stabilize fractures using lightweight materials and manage soft-tissue wounds without compromising future flight capability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="choose">What to Look for in a Raptor Vet</h2>
      <p>Not every avian veterinarian has meaningful raptor experience. When evaluating a potential vet for your falconry bird, consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Raptor-specific caseload.</strong> Ask how many raptors the vet sees per year. A vet who treats primarily parrots and pet birds may not have the hands-on experience with hawks and falcons that your bird needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic equipment.</strong> The clinic should have avian-appropriate radiology, endoscopy capability, and an in-house or rapid-turnaround laboratory for blood work and cultures.</li>
        <li><strong>Surgical capability.</strong> Raptors may need orthopedic surgery (pin or plate fixation for fractures), bumblefoot debridement, or crop surgery. Confirm the vet has performed these procedures on raptors specifically.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency availability.</strong> Raptor emergencies do not respect business hours. Determine whether the vet offers after-hours consultation or emergency visits, or has a referral arrangement with a 24-hour avian emergency hospital.</li>
        <li><strong>Falconry familiarity.</strong> A vet who understands falconry can provide more relevant advice about weight management, conditioning, and the unique stressors faced by hunting birds. Some of the best raptor vets are falconers themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Rehabilitation connections.</strong> Many raptor vets also serve as veterinarians for local wildlife rehabilitation centers, giving them extensive trauma and critical-care experience with a wide range of species.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="emergency">Emergency Care &amp; Preparedness</h2>
      <p>Every falconer should have an emergency plan in place before the hunting season begins. Here is what to prepare:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify your raptor vet in advance.</strong> Do not wait until your bird is injured to start searching. Establish a relationship with a qualified vet, schedule a baseline wellness exam, and confirm their emergency contact protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a field first-aid kit.</strong> Your kit should include hemostatic powder (like styptic powder or cornstarch) for bleeding talons or beaks, gauze and vet wrap for bandaging, a small towel for restraint, saline solution for flushing wounds, and your vet&rsquo;s emergency phone number.</li>
        <li><strong>Know the signs of critical illness.</strong> A raptor that is fluffed up, lethargic, sitting on the ground, breathing with an open mouth, or has visible blood needs immediate veterinary attention. Do not attempt home treatment for serious conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport safely.</strong> Move an injured raptor in a dark, well-ventilated box or carrier to minimize stress. Keep the car warm and quiet. Do not offer food or water unless instructed by your vet.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep a second vet as backup.</strong> If your primary raptor vet is unavailable, having an alternative identified in advance could save your bird&rsquo;s life. University veterinary teaching hospitals with avian departments are an excellent backup option.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="costs">Veterinary Costs for Falconry Birds</h2>
      <p>Raptor veterinary care is specialized and priced accordingly. Budget for these common expenses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual wellness exam:</strong> $75&ndash;$200. Includes physical examination, fecal analysis, and basic blood work.</li>
        <li><strong>Blood panel (CBC and chemistry):</strong> $100&ndash;$250. Essential for detecting metabolic disorders, organ dysfunction, and infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiographs (X-rays):</strong> $100&ndash;$300. Used to evaluate fractures, aspergillosis lesions, and foreign bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Endoscopy:</strong> $200&ndash;$500. The gold standard for diagnosing air sac aspergillosis and evaluating internal organs.</li>
        <li><strong>Surgery (fracture repair, bumblefoot):</strong> $500&ndash;$3,000+. Costs vary widely depending on complexity and post-operative care requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency after-hours visit:</strong> $200&ndash;$500 for the visit alone, plus treatment costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Medications:</strong> $30&ndash;$150 per course, depending on the drug and duration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no widely available pet insurance for falconry birds, so these costs come out of pocket. Many experienced falconers recommend maintaining an emergency veterinary fund of at least $1,000 per bird to avoid being caught unprepared.</p>
