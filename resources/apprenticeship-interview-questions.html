      <h1>Falconry Apprenticeship: 30 Questions to Ask Your Sponsor</h1>
      <p class="lede">Choosing a sponsor is one of the most important decisions in your falconry journey. The right sponsor teaches you to be a competent, ethical falconer. The wrong one can create bad habits, legal problems, or a miserable experience. These questions help you evaluate potential sponsors and find the right match.</p>

      <h2 id="experience">Experience &amp; Background</h2>
      <p>Understanding your potential sponsor's background helps you gauge their knowledge and teaching ability.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>What permit level do you hold, and how long have you been at that level?</strong> — General or Master class is required to sponsor in most states. More experience generally means better mentorship, but some newer General falconers are excellent teachers.</li>
        <li><strong>How many apprentices have you sponsored before?</strong> — First-time sponsors can be great, but experienced ones have refined their teaching approach.</li>
        <li><strong>What happened with your previous apprentices?</strong> — Did they upgrade to General? Are they still active? A track record of successful apprentices is a strong positive signal.</li>
        <li><strong>What species do you currently fly?</strong> — Active hunting falconers make the best sponsors because you learn by doing, not just talking.</li>
        <li><strong>Are you a member of any falconry clubs or NAFA?</strong> — Club membership shows engagement with the broader falconry community and provides you additional networking opportunities.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="expectations">Expectations &amp; Commitment</h2>
      <p>Clear expectations prevent misunderstandings and frustration on both sides.</p>
      <ol start="6">
        <li><strong>What do you expect from an apprentice?</strong> — Some sponsors want you in the field every weekend. Others are more hands-off. Make sure expectations align with your availability.</li>
        <li><strong>How often will we meet or go afield together?</strong> — Weekly contact is ideal during the first season. Monthly is the minimum for a productive apprenticeship.</li>
        <li><strong>How long do you typically sponsor someone before they upgrade?</strong> — The legal minimum is 2 years in most states, but some apprenticeships run 3–4 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Will you help me study for the falconry exam?</strong> — Most states require passing a written exam. A good sponsor provides study resources and quizzes you on material.</li>
        <li><strong>Do you expect me to have all my equipment before trapping?</strong> — Yes is the correct answer. Your mews, perch, and all equipment should be ready and inspected before you acquire a bird.</li>
        <li><strong>Will you inspect my mews before I trap?</strong> — A responsible sponsor always inspects housing before approving a bird acquisition.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="logistics">Logistics &amp; Availability</h2>
      <p>Practical considerations matter. A sponsor 3 hours away is less useful than one 30 minutes away.</p>
      <ol start="12">
        <li><strong>How far away do you live from me?</strong> — Closer is better. You will be meeting frequently, especially during the critical first weeks with a new bird.</li>
        <li><strong>Are you available by phone or text for urgent questions?</strong> — Birds do not wait for business hours. A sick bird at 9 PM needs advice now, not tomorrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Do you have a raptor vet you recommend?</strong> — Every sponsor should know at least one avian vet experienced with raptors.</li>
        <li><strong>Where do you typically hunt?</strong> — Knowing their hunting grounds tells you what terrain and quarry you will encounter.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I come along on your hunts before committing?</strong> — A good sponsor welcomes this. It lets both of you evaluate the fit before formalizing the sponsorship.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="species">Species &amp; Training</h2>
      <p>Your first bird sets the foundation for your entire falconry career.</p>
      <ol start="17">
        <li><strong>What species do you recommend for my first bird?</strong> — In most states, apprentices are limited to Red-tailed Hawks or American Kestrels. Red-tails are the standard recommendation: tough, forgiving, and excellent hunters.</li>
        <li><strong>Will you help me trap my first bird?</strong> — Trapping requires technique and timing. An experienced sponsor makes the process safer and more efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>What quarry will we hunt with my bird?</strong> — Red-tails typically hunt rabbits and squirrels. Knowing the target quarry helps you prepare and find appropriate hunting grounds.</li>
        <li><strong>What training method do you use?</strong> — Manning, creance training, and lure work are standard. Be wary of sponsors who advocate extreme weight reduction or harsh methods.</li>
        <li><strong>How do you approach weight management?</strong> — This is the most critical management skill. Your sponsor should explain flying weight, fat weight, and how to find the right balance for your individual bird.</li>
        <li><strong>What happens if my bird gets sick or injured?</strong> — The answer should involve a vet visit, not home remedies for serious conditions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy &amp; Approach</h2>
      <p>Falconry philosophy varies. Make sure your sponsor's approach resonates with you.</p>
      <ol start="23">
        <li><strong>How do you feel about releasing the apprentice bird at the end of the season?</strong> — Most apprentice red-tails are released after the first season. This is normal and healthy. A sponsor who insists you keep a bird you are not ready for is a concern.</li>
        <li><strong>What is your stance on captive-bred vs. wild-caught birds?</strong> — Both are valid. Sponsors who exclusively push expensive captive-bred birds on apprentices may have financial motives.</li>
        <li><strong>How do you handle disagreements about bird care?</strong> — A sponsor who cannot handle respectful questions is a red flag. You should feel comfortable asking "why" without fear of retaliation.</li>
        <li><strong>What books do you recommend?</strong> — "The Compleat Falconer" by Frank Beebe, "A Rage for Falcons" by Stephen Bodio, and "North American Falconry and Hunting Hawks" are common recommendations. A sponsor who does not read is a concern.</li>
        <li><strong>Do you participate in field meets?</strong> — Field meets are where the falconry community comes together. Sponsors who attend expose you to diverse perspectives and techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>What is the most important lesson you have learned in falconry?</strong> — This open-ended question reveals character, humility, and depth of experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Have you ever lost a bird? What happened?</strong> — Honest sponsors share their failures. Everyone who has flown birds long enough has lost one. How they handled it matters more than the event itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Why do you sponsor apprentices?</strong> — The best answer is some version of "to give back to the sport." Be cautious of sponsors who seem to want free labor or someone to admire them.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refuses to let you observe a hunt first</strong> — If they will not let you see their operation before committing, something may be off.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressures you to buy an expensive captive-bred bird</strong> — Apprentices should start with a trapped passage red-tail in most cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Has no active birds</strong> — A sponsor who is not currently flying is out of practice. You need someone active in the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Dismisses questions</strong> — "Just do what I say" is not mentorship. You should understand the reasoning behind every decision.</li>
        <li><strong>No other falconers know them</strong> — If they are unknown in the local falconry community, investigate why.</li>
        <li><strong>Charges money for sponsorship</strong> — Legitimate sponsors do not charge fees. Sponsorship is a community service, not a business.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive bird collection</strong> — A sponsor with 15 birds and no time to fly them has different priorities than training an apprentice.</li>
      </ul>
