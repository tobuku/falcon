      <h1>How Much Does Falconry Cost? Complete Breakdown</h1>
      <p class="lede">Falconry is not a cheap hobby, but it does not have to break the bank either. This guide provides a realistic, category-by-category breakdown of what you can expect to spend in your first year and beyond. Whether you are budgeting for an apprenticeship or just curious about what falconry actually costs, this is the most detailed cost guide available.</p>

      <h2 id="permits">Permits &amp; Licensing</h2>
      <p>Before you touch a bird, you need permits. The costs here are relatively modest but vary by state:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Falconry exam fee:</strong> $10&ndash;$30 in most states. Some states include this in the permit fee.</li>
        <li><strong>State falconry permit:</strong> $15&ndash;$75 per year. A few states (California, New York, Washington) charge more.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal falconry registration:</strong> $0. The USFWS does not charge a separate federal fee; your state permit covers federal authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Hunting license:</strong> $15&ndash;$50 per year. Most states require a basic hunting license in addition to the falconry permit. Resident licenses are cheaper than non-resident.</li>
        <li><strong>NAFA membership (optional but recommended):</strong> $50&ndash;$75 per year. The North American Falconers Association provides insurance, publications, access to field meets, and a network of experienced falconers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Total permits &amp; licensing: $25&ndash;$200 per year</strong></p>

      <h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
      <p>Equipment is the largest single variable in your first-year budget. A complete kit for an apprentice flying a Red-tailed Hawk includes:</p>

      <h2 id="mews">Mews Construction</h2>
      <p>Your mews (raptor enclosure) is usually the most expensive single investment. Costs depend heavily on whether you build it yourself, hire a contractor, or convert an existing structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DIY from scratch:</strong> $500&ndash;$1,500 for materials. This assumes you have basic carpentry skills, access to tools, and can source lumber and hardware cloth at standard prices. An 8&prime; &times; 8&prime; shed-style mews with a concrete pad is at the low end; a larger, insulated structure with a weathering yard is at the high end.</li>
        <li><strong>Converted shed or outbuilding:</strong> $200&ndash;$800 if you already have a suitable structure. Costs cover adding hardware cloth over windows, installing a perch, predator-proofing, and meeting ventilation requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-built shed + modifications:</strong> $1,000&ndash;$3,000. Buying a pre-made storage shed from a home improvement store and modifying it for falconry is a common middle-ground approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom-built by contractor:</strong> $2,000&ndash;$5,000+. If you hire someone to build the mews, labor costs add significantly to the materials budget.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Typical mews cost for a budget-conscious apprentice: $500&ndash;$1,500</strong></p>

      <h2 id="bird">Acquiring a Bird</h2>
      <p>How you acquire your first bird has a huge impact on cost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wild-trapped passage hawk:</strong> $0 (free). Most apprentices trap a passage (juvenile) Red-tailed Hawk during the fall trapping season. The only cost is the trapping equipment ($20&ndash;$75), which is already included in the equipment section above. This is the traditional and most common path for apprentice falconers.</li>
        <li><strong>Captive-bred bird (General/Master level):</strong> $500&ndash;$15,000 depending on species. Harris&rsquo;s Hawks typically run $800&ndash;$2,500. Captive-bred Peregrines range from $1,500&ndash;$5,000. Gyrfalcons and hybrids can exceed $10,000. Apprentices in most states cannot purchase captive-bred birds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cost for most apprentices: $0</strong> (wild-trapped passage Red-tailed Hawk)</p>

      <h2 id="vet">Veterinary Care</h2>
      <p>Finding an avian veterinarian experienced with raptors is essential. Vet costs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial exam after trapping:</strong> $75&ndash;$200. A fecal float for parasites, physical exam, and blood panel are recommended for every newly trapped hawk.</li>
        <li><strong>Parasite treatment (if needed):</strong> $20&ndash;$50 for medication.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual wellness exam:</strong> $75&ndash;$150.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency vet visit:</strong> $200&ndash;$500+. Injuries, aspergillosis, or other emergencies can happen. Budget for at least one unexpected vet visit per year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Annual vet costs: $200&ndash;$500</strong></p>

      <h2 id="food">Food &amp; Nutrition</h2>
      <p>Raptors eat whole prey items: quail, mice, day-old chicks, and occasionally rabbit or other game. Monthly food costs depend on your bird&rsquo;s size and how much wild-caught game it takes during the hunting season:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frozen quail:</strong> $1.50&ndash;$3.00 each. A Red-tailed Hawk eats roughly one quail per day when not hunting, or 30 per month.</li>
        <li><strong>Frozen mice:</strong> $0.50&ndash;$1.50 each. Used for smaller hawks and kestrels, or as supplements.</li>
        <li><strong>Day-old chicks:</strong> $0.30&ndash;$0.75 each. The most economical option. Nutritionally adequate for most species when supplemented with other food sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Wild-caught game:</strong> Free. During hunting season, quarry your hawk catches (squirrels, rabbits, starlings) can supplement the diet significantly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Monthly food cost: $20&ndash;$60</strong> ($240&ndash;$720 per year)</p>

      <h2 id="ongoing">Ongoing Annual Costs</h2>
      <p>After the first-year investment, ongoing annual costs are more modest:</p>
      <table class="compare-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Category</th>

      </table>
      <p>Most apprentice falconers who build their own mews and make some of their own equipment spend between <strong>$1,800 and $3,500</strong> in the first year. This is comparable to other outdoor sports like hunting, fly fishing, or horseback riding when you factor in the initial gear investment.</p>

      <h2 id="save">Ways to Save Money</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make your own equipment.</strong> Jesses, anklets, leashes, and bewits can all be made from leather scraps for a fraction of the retail cost. Your sponsor can teach you.</li>
        <li><strong>Convert an existing structure.</strong> A garden shed, unused chicken coop, or section of a garage can often be converted into a mews for $200&ndash;$500.</li>
        <li><strong>Buy used.</strong> Telemetry receivers, hawking vests, and perches are frequently sold second-hand through falconry forums and club swap meets.</li>
        <li><strong>Join NAFA or your state club.</strong> Members often share equipment, food sources, and building materials. Some clubs maintain lending libraries of telemetry equipment for apprentices.</li>
        <li><strong>Trap your own bird.</strong> Wild-trapped passage Red-tailed Hawks are free and are the standard apprentice bird in most states.</li>
        <li><strong>Buy food in bulk.</strong> Frozen quail and chicks are significantly cheaper when bought in large quantities from reptile or raptor food suppliers.</li>
      </ul>
