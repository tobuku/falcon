      <h1>How to Find a Falconry Sponsor</h1>
      <p class="lede">Finding a sponsor is one of the biggest hurdles for aspiring falconers. In most states, you cannot obtain an apprentice falconry permit without a General or Master falconer willing to serve as your sponsor for at least two years. This guide explains where to look, how to approach potential sponsors, and what to do if your first attempts do not work out.</p>

      <h2 id="why">Why You Need a Sponsor</h2>
      <p>The sponsor requirement exists because falconry involves the welfare of a live animal and compliance with complex federal and state regulations. A sponsor is not just a formality&mdash;they are your hands-on teacher, your safety net, and your connection to the broader falconry community.</p>
      <p>Legally, a sponsor must hold a General or Master falconry license and agree to supervise your apprenticeship for the full two-year minimum. The sponsor&rsquo;s name appears on your permit application, and in most states, they are considered partially responsible for your bird&rsquo;s welfare during the apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>In practice, a good sponsor will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help you study for and pass the falconry exam</li>
        <li>Inspect your mews and suggest improvements before the state inspection</li>
        <li>Teach you to trap, handle, and train your first bird</li>
        <li>Go hunting with you and provide feedback on your field technique</li>
        <li>Help you manage your bird&rsquo;s weight and recognize signs of illness</li>
        <li>Introduce you to other falconers and the broader community</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="where">Where to Find Sponsors</h2>
      <h3>1. State Falconry Clubs</h3>
      <p>Every state with an active falconry community has at least one falconry club, and most are affiliated with the North American Falconers Association (NAFA). State clubs are the single best place to meet potential sponsors because their members are already involved in the sport and many are willing to mentor newcomers.</p>
      <p>Search online for &ldquo;[your state] falconry club&rdquo; or check the NAFA website for a list of affiliated clubs. Most clubs hold regular meetings, field meets, and social events where you can introduce yourself.</p>

      <h3>2. NAFA Field Meets &amp; Events</h3>
      <p>The North American Falconers Association hosts an annual field meet (usually in November) that draws falconers from across the country. State and regional clubs hold their own meets as well. Attending a field meet&mdash;even as a non-falconer&mdash;is one of the best ways to meet experienced falconers, watch them hunt, and demonstrate your genuine interest in the sport.</p>

      <h3>3. Falconry Schools &amp; Workshops</h3>
      <p>Many falconry schools maintain relationships with active sponsors in their region and can facilitate introductions after you complete their course. This is one of the most significant benefits of formal falconry education.</p>

      <h3>4. Wildlife Agency Contacts</h3>
      <p>Your state wildlife agency maintains a list of licensed falconers. While they typically will not share personal contact information, some agencies will forward a message from a prospective apprentice to licensed falconers in your area. It does not hurt to ask.</p>

      <h3>5. Raptor Rehabilitation Centers</h3>
      <p>Volunteering at a raptor rehabilitation center puts you in contact with experienced bird handlers, some of whom are active falconers. Even if you do not find a sponsor there, the experience handling raptors demonstrates commitment and gives you a practical foundation.</p>

      <h3>6. Online Falconry Communities</h3>
      <p>While you should never ask someone to be your sponsor in an online forum without meeting them first, online communities are excellent for learning, asking questions, and identifying falconers in your area who might be open to mentoring. See the Online Communities section below for specific resources.</p>

      <h2 id="approach">How to Approach a Potential Sponsor</h2>
      <p>Approaching an experienced falconer and asking them to invest two or more years of their time in mentoring you is a significant ask. Here is how to make a positive impression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do your homework first.</strong> Read at least one comprehensive falconry book (<em>The Apprentice Falconer</em> by Ben Oakes is an excellent starting point). Study your state&rsquo;s falconry regulations. A sponsor wants to see that you have already invested time and effort into learning before you approach them.</li>
        <li><strong>Be respectful of their time.</strong> Falconers are busy people who hunt, care for their birds, and often have families and careers. Do not show up unannounced. Send a brief, polite email or message introducing yourself, explaining your interest in falconry, what you have done to prepare, and asking if they would be willing to meet.</li>
        <li><strong>Meet in person.</strong> A phone call or message can open the door, but the real relationship starts in person. Offer to meet at their convenience&mdash;at a club meeting, a field meet, or even to help with mews chores.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask good questions.</strong> Show genuine curiosity about falconry, not just eagerness to get a bird. Ask about their experience, their birds, their hunting style. Listen more than you talk.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer to help.</strong> One of the best ways to build a relationship with a potential sponsor is to offer your time. Help with mews cleaning, brush beating during hunts, or any other task they need assistance with. This demonstrates commitment and gives them a chance to evaluate you in a low-pressure setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> A sponsor may want to interact with you over several weeks or months before committing to a formal sponsorship. This is normal and healthy&mdash;both parties are evaluating the fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not beg or pressure.</strong> If someone declines, thank them and move on. Ask if they know anyone else who might be willing to sponsor. Falconry is a small community, and a positive impression on one falconer often leads to an introduction to another.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="expect">What Sponsors Expect from You</h2>
      <p>Understanding what sponsors look for helps you prepare:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-motivation.</strong> Sponsors want apprentices who drive their own learning. Read books, watch educational videos, attend club meetings, and ask informed questions. Do not wait for your sponsor to spoon-feed you information.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability.</strong> If you say you will be somewhere, be there. If you commit to helping with a hunt, show up on time. Unreliable apprentices burn out sponsors quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical willingness.</strong> Falconry is an outdoor sport that involves walking through brush, climbing fences, and getting muddy. Sponsors need to know you are willing and able to be in the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for the bird.</strong> The raptor&rsquo;s welfare always comes first. Sponsors watch closely for how you handle and talk about the birds. Treating the hawk as a pet, a possession, or a status symbol is a red flag.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term commitment.</strong> The two-year apprenticeship is a minimum, not a finish line. Sponsors invest their time in people who plan to be active falconers for years, not in people who want to try it for one season.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial readiness.</strong> You need to be able to afford the equipment, mews, food, and vet care. A sponsor does not want to commit to mentoring someone who cannot afford to care for a bird properly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="flags">Red Flags in a Potential Sponsor</h2>
      <p>Not every licensed falconer makes a good sponsor. Watch for these warning signs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>They do not actively fly birds.</strong> A sponsor who has not hunted in years cannot provide the hands-on mentoring you need. Ask when they last flew a bird and how often they hunt.</li>
        <li><strong>They want money.</strong> Sponsoring an apprentice is a volunteer commitment. If someone asks for payment in exchange for sponsoring you, walk away.</li>
        <li><strong>They are difficult to reach.</strong> If a potential sponsor takes weeks to return calls or emails and cancels meetings repeatedly, the sponsorship will be frustrating for both of you.</li>
        <li><strong>Their birds look unhealthy.</strong> If you see a sponsor&rsquo;s birds and they appear thin, have damaged feathers, or live in substandard conditions, that person is not someone you want to learn from.</li>
        <li><strong>They pressure you to skip steps.</strong> Any sponsor who suggests cutting corners on the exam, the mews inspection, or legal requirements is putting your permit and the bird at risk.</li>
        <li><strong>They have a bad reputation in the community.</strong> Ask other falconers about potential sponsors. The falconry community is small, and reputations are well-known.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="online">Online Communities &amp; Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TheModernApprentice.com:</strong> A comprehensive website dedicated to apprentice falconers, with detailed guides on finding sponsors, studying for the exam, and navigating the first year.</li>
        <li><strong>Falconry-related subreddits:</strong> The r/birdsofprey and r/falconry communities on Reddit include experienced falconers who answer questions and occasionally connect with apprentices in their area.</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook falconry groups:</strong> State-specific falconry groups on Facebook are active and often the fastest way to connect with local falconers. Search for &ldquo;[your state] falconry&rdquo; on Facebook.</li>
        <li><strong>NAFA forums:</strong> Members of the North American Falconers Association have access to forums and regional contact lists.</li>
        <li><strong>Falconry podcasts and YouTube channels:</strong> Following falconry content creators helps you learn the language and culture of the sport, which makes you a more informed and appealing apprentice candidate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="patience">If You Cannot Find a Sponsor</h2>
      <p>Some areas have very few active falconers, making the sponsor search difficult. If you have been looking for months without success:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expand your search radius.</strong> A sponsor does not have to live next door, though closer is better. Some states allow sponsors from neighboring states. A sponsor within a 1&ndash;2 hour drive is workable.</li>
        <li><strong>Attend out-of-area events.</strong> Travel to field meets, NAFA events, or falconry schools in other regions. The connections you make can lead to introductions back home.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep learning.</strong> Use the waiting time productively. Pass the written exam, build your mews, accumulate equipment, and deepen your knowledge. When a sponsor does appear, you will be ready to start immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact your state wildlife agency.</strong> Explain that you are a serious prospective falconer who cannot find a sponsor. Some agencies will make extra efforts to connect you with licensed falconers in your area.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay visible in the community.</strong> Keep attending club meetings, volunteering at raptor centers, and participating in online forums. Persistence and genuine dedication eventually catch the attention of experienced falconers.</li>
      </ul>
