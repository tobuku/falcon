      <h2 id="furniture">Falconry Furniture (Bird Equipment)</h2>
      <p>Falconry furniture refers to the equipment attached to or worn by the bird. These are the items you will use every single day, so quality matters. Poorly made furniture can injure your hawk or cause a lost bird.</p>

      <h2 id="housing">Housing &amp; Perching</h2>
      <p>Federal regulations require an approved enclosure (mews) before you can obtain a falconry permit. Your mews must pass a state inspection, and the bird needs appropriate perching inside and in a weathering area.</p>

      <p>Most apprentice falconers spend between $1,500 and $3,000 on equipment in their first year. Building your own mews and making your own furniture can keep costs at the lower end. Telemetry is the single biggest variable&mdash;a basic VHF setup runs $350&ndash;$500, while GPS systems can exceed $1,000.</p>
