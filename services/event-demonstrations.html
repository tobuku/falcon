      <h2 id="what">What Is a Falconry Demonstration?</h2>
      <p>A falconry demonstration is a live presentation where a licensed falconer showcases trained raptors — typically hawks, falcons, or owls — to an audience. Demonstrations can include free-flight displays, bird handling, educational talks about raptor biology, and interactive experiences where attendees can hold a bird on a gloved hand.</p>
      <p>These events are led by falconers who hold USDA exhibition permits and carry liability insurance. The birds are captive-bred and trained specifically for public interaction, ensuring both audience safety and bird welfare.</p>

      <h2 id="types">Types of Events</h2>
      <p>Falconry demonstrations work across a wide range of settings. Here are the most common booking types:</p>

      <p><span class="key-stat">900% YoY growth</span> — "Falconry experience near me" is the fastest-growing falconry search term in the United States, reflecting surging public interest in interactive raptor encounters.</p>

      <h2 id="hiring">What to Look for When Hiring a Falconer</h2>
      <p>Not all falconry demonstration providers are equal. Here's what to verify before booking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>USDA exhibition permit</strong> — Required by federal law for any public display of raptors. Ask to see the permit number.</li>
        <li><strong>Liability insurance</strong> — Professional providers carry general liability coverage. Most venues require a certificate of insurance.</li>
        <li><strong>State falconry permit</strong> — The handler should hold a valid state falconry license at the General or Master level.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience with public events</strong> — Birds used in demonstrations need specific temperament and training. Ask how many events they've done.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety protocols</strong> — A professional will assess the venue, establish a flight perimeter, and brief the audience on behavior expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Bird welfare standards</strong> — The birds should appear healthy, well-manned, and comfortable around crowds. Multiple birds should be rotated to avoid stress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="cost">Typical Costs</h2>
      <p>Pricing for falconry demonstrations varies by region, event type, duration, and number of birds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small private experience (1–6 people):</strong> $150–$500</li>
        <li><strong>Birthday party or small group:</strong> $300–$800</li>
        <li><strong>School assembly or classroom visit:</strong> $250–$600</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate event:</strong> $500–$2,500</li>
        <li><strong>Film/photography (half day):</strong> $1,000–$3,000+</li>
        <li><strong>Wedding flyover or ring delivery:</strong> $500–$1,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Travel fees may apply for events outside the falconer's local area. Most providers offer custom quotes based on your specific needs.</p>

      <h2 id="safety">Safety and Legal Requirements</h2>
      <p>Falconry demonstrations are regulated at both the federal and state level. Key requirements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The falconer must hold a USDA Class C Exhibitor license for any paid public display.</li>
        <li>State wildlife agencies may have additional permitting requirements for exhibition.</li>
        <li>Indoor venues need adequate ceiling height and controlled exits. Outdoor venues need a clear flight area away from roads and power lines.</li>
        <li>Audience members should not approach birds without handler guidance. Flash photography policies vary by provider.</li>
        <li>The falconer is responsible for the birds at all times. Guests should follow all handler instructions.</li>
      </ul>
